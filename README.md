## Afterthoughts

Finished the first round of working with this project on the 12th of December, 2024. I am content with how it turned out, however I feel like my .css file is one big mess and there are some things I left out, for example in the given example image's quote section the author's name appears to be inside the padding/margin area of the quote text. I'm not sure if this is something you can actually do or if the bottom space simply just belongs to the author part.

Nevertheless I enjoyed building this project and I will most likely come back to it at a later date!
